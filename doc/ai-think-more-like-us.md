DeepMind的推进可以促使机器更好地理解场景

###### Machines will need to get a lot better at making sense of the world on their own if they are ever going to become truly intelligent.

机器想要变得真正智能， 就要靠自己更好地理解世界。

###### DeepMind, the AI-focused subsidiary of Alphabet, has taken a step in that direction by making a computer program that builds a mental picture of the world all by itself. You might say that it learns to imagine the world around it.

Alphabet 旗下子公司 DeepMind， 专注于AI， 在这个方向已经迈出了一步，它创建了一个能自主构建心理图景的程序，你可以说它学会了想象周边的世界

###### The system, which uses what DeepMind’s researchers call a generative query network (GQN), looks at a scene from several angles and can then describe what it would look like from another angle.

该系统使用DeepMind的研究人员所称的生成查询网络(GQN)，从几个角度观察场景，然后从另一个角度描述它的样子

###### This might seem trivial, but it requires a relatively sophisticated ability to learn about the physical world. In contrast to many AI vision systems, the DeepMind program makes sense of a scene more the way a person does. Even if something is partly occluded, for example, it can reason about what’s there.

这可能看起来微不足道，但它需要相对复杂的能力来了解物理世界。与许多人工智能视觉系统不同的是，DeepMind程序更像人一样理解场景。例如，即使某物被部分遮挡，它也能推断出那里有什么

###### Eventually, such technology might help serve as the foundation for deeper artificial intelligence, letting machines describe and reason about the world with much greater sophistication.

最终，这类技术可能成为更深层次人工智能的基础，让机器以更复杂的方式描述和推理世界。

###### Ali Eslami, a research scientist at DeepMind, and his colleagues tested the approach on three virtual settings: a block-like tabletop, a virtual robot arm, and a simple maze. The system uses two neural networks; one learns and another generates, or “imagines,” new perspectives. The system captures aspects of a scene, including object shapes, positions, and colors, using a vector representation, which makes it relatively efficient. The research appears in the journal Science today.

DeepMind的研究科学家阿里•埃斯拉米(Ali Eslami)和他的同事在三个虚拟环境中测试了这种方法:一个类似方块的桌面、一个虚拟机器人手臂和一个简单的迷宫。该系统使用两个神经网络;一个人学习，另一个人产生新的视角。该系统使用向量表示来捕获场景的各个方面，包括对象形状、位置和颜色，这相对高效。这项研究发表在今天的《科学》杂志上。

###### The work is something of a new direction for DeepMind, which has made its name by developing programs capable of performing remarkable feats, including learning how to play the complex and abstract board game Go. The new project builds upon other academic research that seeks to mimic human perception and intelligence using similar computational tools.

开发程序， 完成包括学习如何玩复杂且抽象的棋盘游戏GO这样的壮举成为DeepMind的新方向， 它也籍此获得声名。 这个新项目建立在其他使用计算工具模拟人类认知和智能的学术研究之上。

###### “It is an interesting and valuable step in the right direction,” says Josh Tenenbaum, a professor who leads the Computational Cognitive Science group at MIT.

“这是朝着正确方向迈出的有趣而有价值的一步，”麻省理工学院(MIT)计算认知科学小组负责人乔什·特南鲍姆(Josh Tenenbaum)教授说。

###### Tenenbaum says the ability to deal with complex scenes in a modular way is impressive but adds that the approach shows the same limitations as other machine-learning methods, including a need for a huge amount of training data: “The jury is still out on how much of the problem this solves.”

乔什·特南鲍姆(Josh Tenenbaum)说,模块化处理复杂场景的能力令人印象深刻,但补充说,这种方法与其他机器学习方法有相同的局限,包括需要大量的训练数据:“评审委员会仍然怀疑它究竟能解决多少问题。”

###### Sam Gershman, who heads the Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at Harvard, says the DeepMind work combines some important ideas about how human visual perception works. But he notes that, like other AI programs, it is somewhat narrow, in that it can answer only a single query: what would a scene look like from a different viewpoint?

哈佛大学计算认知神经科学实验室的负责人Sam Gershman说，DeepMind的工作结合了一些关于人类视觉感知如何工作的重要观点。但他指出，与其他人工智能程序一样，它也有一定的局限性，因为它只能回答一个问题:从不同的角度看，一个场景会是什么样子?

###### “In contrast, humans can answer an infinite variety of queries about a scene,” Gershman says. “What would a scene look like if I moved the blue circle a bit to the left, or repainted the red triangle, or squashed the yellow cube?

格什曼说:“相比之下，人类可以回答关于场景的各种各样的问题。”“如果我把蓝色的圆圈移到左边，或者重新涂上红色的三角形，或者把黄色的方块压扁，那会是什么样子?”

###### Gershman says it’s unclear whether DeepMind’s approach could be adapted to answer more complex questions or whether some fundamentally different approach might be required.

格什曼说，目前还不清楚DeepMind的方法是否可以用于回答更复杂的问题，或者是否需要一些本质上不同的方法。
